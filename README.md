# Learning ML with no background
Notes and thoughts on learning machine learning. This guide is dedicated to the one and only [Adnaan Sachidanandan](https://github.com/adnaans).

### @kvfrans
- The [classic Andrew Ng course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera is a good place to start. You don't have to finish the whole thing but it's a good introduction

- Andrej Kaparthy's [hacker guide to neural nets](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/) is very helpful for anyone with programming background. Go through and actually implement it yourself without copy-pasting, and get a neural net to classify something easy (i did RBG colors -> "blue","green")

- Stanford [cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) and [cs224d](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/) are great, and they post lectures online. Do the projects/homework too! It's probably the most useful part since you learn tensorflow.

- Congrats, at this point you'll have a good enough background to get started on whatever project you want. Build a bunch of things and you'll learn a bunch of things.

### @gmittal
- I tried a lot of different starting points, but my personal favorite has been [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) by Michael Nielsen. It's written very well, and someone with basic matrix and calculus knowledge can get up and running with machine learning quickly.

- If you like videos, [Siraj Raval's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A) has a lot of intuitive explanations of the math behind some of the major concepts and also describes some of the newer research coming out of the field.

- To reiterate what @kvfrans said, Stanford's [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) and [CS224d](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/) are really good places to get your feet wet with building out networks and turning some of the math into code.

- [FastAI](http://fast.ai) is a great starting point for anyone with some programming experience. I've watched some of the lectures and they are really helpful, especially with getting you off the ground with deep models. 

- Build lots of things. I started learning by modifying toy code I found online. I then started building projects that interested me using any resources I could find. If you're lost for inspiration, check out [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), there are plenty of interesting problems people are trying to solve and occasionally companies post competitions (with fairly large payouts) for those who can build the best models.

### Additional Information

- Andrew Ng's new Deep Learning course. Haven't gone through it, but looks good.

- It doesn't really matter if you use Tensorflow or Pytorch or anything, just pick one to start with. Also, implementing backprop by hand is a good exercise you can figure out what's happening. Don't actually use it for anything big though. 

- When working on projects don't be afraid to steal parts of code from other git repos / stackoverflow. Our philosophy: do whatever it takes to make your project work. If you work on interesting enough things, the experience will come naturally.
