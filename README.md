# Learning ML with no background
Notes and thoughts on learning machine learning. This guide is dedicated to the one and only [Adnaan Sachidanandan](https://github.com/adnaans).

### Kevins path
- The [classic Andrew Ng course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on coursera is a good place to start. You don't have to finish the whole thing but it's a good introduction

- Andrej Kaparthy's [hacker guide to neural nets](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/) is very helpful for anyone with programming background. Go through and actually implement it yourself without copy-pasting, and get a neural net to classify something easy (i did RBG colors -> "blue","green")

- Stanford [cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) and [cs224d](http://cs224d.stanford.edu/) are great, and they post lectures online. Do the projects/homework too! It's probably the most useful part since you learn tensorflow.

- Congrats, at this point you'll have a good enough background to get started on whatever project you want. Build a bunch of things and you'll learn a bunch of things.

### Gautams stuff
[put some things here!]

### Other stuff

- I heard good things about fast.ai although I haven't gone through it myself. Same for Andrew Ng's new Deep Learning course.

- [Neural nets and deep learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) is worth reading through. Everything's in easy to understand language.

- It doesn't really matter if you use Tensorflow or Pytorch or anything, just pick one to start with. Also, implementing backprop by hand is a good exercise you can figure out what's happening. Don't actually use it for anything big though

- When working on projects dont be afraid to steal parts of code from other github repos / stackoverflow. My philosophy: do whatever it takes to make your project work. If you work on interesting enough things, the experience will come naturally
